# Crypto Clustering
Welcome to the **CryptoClustering** repository! This project utilizes Python and unsupervised machine learning to analyze and predict how cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour and 7-day price changes. The primary goals of the assignment are to:

1. **Preprocess and scale cryptocurrency data** for analysis.
2. **Use K-means clustering** to group cryptocurrencies based on price changes.
3. **Optimize clustering with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.
4. **Visualize and compare clustering results** from original data vs PCA-reduced data.

## Structure

**Crypto_Clustering.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook where all the code and analysis are conducted.

**crypto_market_data.csv**: The raw dataset containing cryptocurrency price change data over 24 hours and 7 days.
